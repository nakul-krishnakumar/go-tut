//! WHEN TO USE INTERFACES?
/*//* Use interfaces when:
		- You want flexibility (plug-and-play behavior).

		- You want to follow dependency inversion â€” depend on abstractions, not implementations.

		- You want to mock behavior (e.g., in tests).

type paymenter interface {

//* Here, if we did not use an interface, we will have to explicitly hard code which payment gateway(stripe or razorpay) at initialization itself.
//? When we use interface, we can setup a payment Interface (paymenter <IPaymentGateway>) which let us choose which payment method to choose
//! For this payment interface to work, all the payment gateways (stripe, razorpay) should have the `pay(amount float32) bool` function
